This is a port of the i9010 armani source for the captivate that I wanted to do for myself. If you want it take it :-)

First of all thanks to:

for the help with the kernel source, if I missed you tell me and I'll add you. ;-)

and the guys at TeamKomin for the help getting me motivated to start. :-)

HOW TO BUILD KERNEL 2.6.32 FOR Captivate

1. Visit http://www.codesourcery.com/, download and install Sourcery G++ Lite 2009q3-68 or 2010.09-51 toolchain for ARM EABI.

2. git clone kernel source the top directory. i.e. your home dir

3. Update the makfile to point to where you installed the toolchain above

4. Run build.sh script in the kernel directory. Useage is ./build.sh captivate to refresh config and ./build.sh noconfig to keep current config
   the default config used for refresh is ga_aries_config and is correct for this kernel

5. If the kernel is built successfully, you will find following files from the top directory:
	arch/arm/boot/zImage
	net/netfilter/xt_TCPMSS.ko
	drivers/onedram_svn/modemctl/modemctl.ko
	drivers/onedram_svn/onedram/onedram.ko
	drivers/onedram_svn/svnet/svnet.ko
	drivers/bluetooth/bthid/bthid.ko
	drivers/net/wireless/bcm4329/dhd.ko
	drivers/scsi/scsi_wait_scan.ko
	drivers/samsung/vibetonz/vibrator.ko
